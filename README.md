# UOP sports

A Flutter mobile application project

# Overview

This project is an improvement to the current UoP sports app as at October 2022.
The application is designed to improve the user interface and user experience and show the importance of both in a mobile application with its benefit to a business

# Features
* The most important thing is the all new refreshing look of the application, better navigation around the application using a modern bottom navigation bar against having all the pages chunked in one screen.
  placing things where people can easily navigate to them and use the entire application without needing a manual!

* The application has booking functionalities at its core, providing a better user experience for users to book time slots for services at the sports centre.
  A better user interface for the booking has been put in place against the current one, This reduces clusters and provides a simple, yet effective booking system.
  Work is stil bein done on booking capacity reflections. The page is expected to show how much slots are available and the ones times that have been totally booked.
  
* An all new, 'What's on' page, This allows users to see what is happening in the facility as soon as they open the app. Any news and updates on the facilities, events and other exciting news.

# Additional Future features

## Membership system
The application looks to provide a better platform for managing subscriptions and also giving users the opportunity to track their memberships from the palm of their hands
This feature is on hold as further business requirements are required to fulfil this.

## Facility activity status
This feature maps into the booking system and might be further looked into integrating into the in-house entry scan system.
This is to track how busy a certain facility in the sports centre is. Using data from the bookings and the entry scan, A rough estimate can be worked into how busy the centre is which allows the users to plan their visits adequately and also prevent overcrowding.
